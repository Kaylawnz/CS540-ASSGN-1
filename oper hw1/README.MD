This is a C++ program to run shell commands. I used the the functions that were required in the code. To use this you will type in a number for the command you want.

1 = dir
2 = pwd
3 = mkdir
4 = echo
5 = type
6 = exit

I used a do while loop to keep it going until you want to exit. I also used cases to run the command you want.
